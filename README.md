# Project-2
This is the repository for my second of two final projects for CIST - 1620
This project is kind of hard to describe, so firstly I would recomend watching the following youtube video that explains Zipf's law a lot better than I can

Now that you understand Zipf's law my project scrapes a notepad file and compares the frequency of a random word from a list of the 1000 most common words that I found
to the frequency of that word in the notepad file you present the program with.
I recommend that you use the test.csv file I attached since the program works much better the greater the variety of words that you give it.
